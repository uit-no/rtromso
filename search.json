    "text": "We were delighted with the turnout at RTromsø’s first meeting on 2024-04-17. Held in the SVHUM E0101 auditorium, the meeting was attended by over 65 people from departments across UiT’s campus. Pizza was provided by Radovan Bast with funding from the Research Software Engineering group at UiT.\nThose who attended were invited to respond to polls to give us a better idea about who was attending the meeting. From these we learned that:\n\nThe three largest roles were researchers, PhD students and Masters students.\nThe two largest faculties represented were the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Biosciences, Fisheries and Economics.\nMost attendees described themselves as having limited to moderate experience with R.\n\nWhen polled attendees’ preferences, we observed:\n\nRoughly equal interest in presentation, tutorial, help session, and problem solving formats\nSlight preference for scheduling meetings on alternating days of the week\nMeeting frequency preference split mostly between every two weeks and every month.\n10 people willing to help out at help sessions, 5 willing to give tutorials, and 5 willing help with written materials.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, a brief introduction to UiT’s Research Data Portal was provided by Philipp Conzett.",
